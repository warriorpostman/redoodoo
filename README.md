# Simple Demonstration of Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is my attempt to create the simplest example of using Redux + React. It is a synchronous example that has one action, one reducer. 

DisplayContainer is a "container" or "smart" component that connects with Display (the "dumb" or "presentational" component" by implementing `mapStateToProps`.

##How to run it 
`npm install && npm start`
